## What is a to-do list?

To-do lists are simple yet effective tools that can break down bigger tasks into smaller, concrete steps. They range from a daily task checklist to outlining all the tasks in an entire project. You can make a to-do list for any project anytime your team needs to get something done. Breaking down tasks into concrete steps helps your team reach your goals with ease.

## What are the benefits of to-do lists?

There’s a reason why so many people find to-do lists helpful. Let’s take a look at some of the benefits:

•	Improve organization: To-do lists are a great way to organize tasks. From mundane, everyday activities to more difficult and complex tasks, a to-do list helps you structure your workload and organize everything in one location. <br>
•	Increase focus: When you know what you have to do in the day ahead, you can focus on what needs to be done. If you don’t have a clear picture of what needs to be completed, you might struggle to focus. <br>
•	Boost productivity: With an increase in focus, you’re likely to see an increase in productivity, too. Why? Because having a to-do list means you’ll spend less time figuring out what you need to do and more time getting things done. <br>
•	Better prioritization: If you use this to do list, you’ll be able to prioritize tasks based on their level of urgency. That way, you know that you’re completing urgent tasks on time. <br>
•	Offers a sense of accomplishment: There’s no denying it: ticking items off a list is a good feeling. And what better way to do that than with a to-do list? <br>
•	Reduces stress: Using a to-do list to outline your tasks takes a weight off your mind. You know that everything is scheduled into your workweek, putting you in a much clearer headspace to focus on the tasks at hand.

## When should you create a to-do list?

Ultimately, you should create a to-do list whenever you need to get a handle on your workload and organize your tasks. Let’s take a look at some examples.

•	If you’re feeling overwhelmed. It can feel pretty overwhelming when you have a lot of work in your schedule and no plan to work through them. This is where creating a to-do list can be useful. Outlining all your tasks and activities in a list can help you visualize when and how you’ll be able to get your work done.

•	If you want to maximize your time. Planning your tasks and activities helps you be more efficient with your time. Your to-do list outlines everything you need to do, allowing you to focus your time and efforts on the right tasks. You won’t waste time on tasks that aren’t necessary. <br>
•	If you have a lot of upcoming deadlines. When there are a lot of deadlines on the horizon, some of which might be conflicting, it can get tricky. To make sure you hit these deadlines, you can use a to-do list to schedule your tasks and note all your deadlines. As a result, you’ll have a clear picture of what you need to do and when you need to do it to reach your deadlines.
